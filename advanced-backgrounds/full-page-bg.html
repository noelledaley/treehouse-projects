		What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Your shields were failing, sir. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapes? Are you up for promotion? You enjoyed that.
