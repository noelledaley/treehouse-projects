		    Computer, belay that order. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Damage report! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Not if I weaken first. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?
