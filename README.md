==================

An archive of projects I've completed while teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and so forth. The majority of projects are from the [Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com]) curriculum, although I've also found the following other resources helpful: 

*[Learn How to Program](http://learnhowtoprogram.com)
*[The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com)
*[The Mozilla Developer Network](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
