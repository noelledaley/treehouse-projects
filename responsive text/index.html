			Shields up! <a href="#">Rrrrred alert!</a> Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You enjoyed that. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?

		<h2>You just destroyed the Enterprise.</h2>

			I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. <b>Fate protects fools</b>, little children and ships named Enterprise. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. They were just sucked into space. &ldquo;If it's not broken, don't fix it.&rdquo;

It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once.&hellip;

		<h2>Why Use One?</h2>

			Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Sorry, Data. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Talk about going nowhere fast. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. <a href="#">Flair</a> is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. We have a saboteur aboard. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. The unexpected is our normal routine. Not if I weaken first. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.
